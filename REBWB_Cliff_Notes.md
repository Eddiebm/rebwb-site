## The Three Truths of Real Estate Investing

**Truth #1: Cash flow is oxygen.**
Without positive cash flow, your investment is a liability disguised as an asset. Never buy a property that can't breathe on its own.

**Truth #2: You make money when you buy, not when you sell.**
The purchase price determines your returns. Overpay, and no amount of appreciation will save you.

**Truth #3: Real estate is a business, not a lottery ticket.**
Treat every property like a small business. Track expenses, manage tenants professionally, and run the numbers honestly.

## The Kill Switch Framework

Before committing to any deal, ask yourself:

1. **Can I walk away?** If emotions are driving the decision, stop.
2. **What's the worst case?** Calculate your maximum loss scenario.
3. **Do the numbers work without assumptions?** Remove appreciation hopes and test with current reality.
4. **Is there a clear exit?** Know how you'll get out before you get in.
5. **Am I solving a problem or creating one?** Good deals solve problems. Bad deals create them.

## The 5 Disqualification Criteria

Reject any deal that fails these tests:

| Criteria | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| Cash-on-Cash Return | < 8% = Walk |
| Cap Rate | < 6% in your market = Investigate |
| Debt Service Coverage | < 1.25 = Too risky |
| Vacancy Assumption | < 8% = Unrealistic |
| Reserve Fund | < 6 months expenses = Undercapitalized |

## The Numbers That Matter

### Cash Flow Calculation
```
Gross Rent
- Vacancy (8%)
- Property Management (10%)
- Maintenance Reserve (5%)
- Property Taxes
- Insurance
- HOA (if applicable)
= Net Operating Income (NOI)

NOI - Mortgage Payment = Cash Flow
```

### Key Metrics
- **Cash-on-Cash Return** = Annual Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested
- **Cap Rate** = NOI ÷ Purchase Price
- **1% Rule** = Monthly Rent ≥ 1% of Purchase Price (quick filter only)
- **50% Rule** = Assume 50% of rent goes to expenses (rough estimate)

---

## Red Flags That Kill Deals

- Seller won't provide rent rolls or expense history
- "Pro forma" numbers that assume everything improves
- Deferred maintenance hiding in cosmetic updates
- Foundation, roof, or HVAC issues discovered in inspection
- Neighborhood decline indicators (vacancy rates, crime trends)
- Unrealistic rent increase projections
- Seller financing with balloon payments

## The Operator's Mindset

1. **Discipline over enthusiasm** – Say no more than you say yes
2. **Systems over hustle** – Build processes that scale
3. **Data over intuition** – Trust the spreadsheet, not the feeling
4. **Long-term over quick wins** – Wealth builds slowly
5. **Walking away is a win** – Every bad deal avoided is money saved

**The best investors aren't the most aggressive. They're the most disciplined.**
