                <p class="text-xl">Real stories of deals gone wrong—and what they taught me about conservative investing.</p>

                <p>I've made money in real estate. I've also made mistakes that cost me real money—not theoretical opportunity costs, but actual cash that left my bank account and never came back. Here are five lessons I learned the expensive way, so maybe you won't have to.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Lesson 1: Cash Flow Projections Are Always Optimistic</h2>
                <p>My second property was a triplex I bought in 2010. The seller provided a rent roll showing $2,400 per month in total rent. I verified that comparable units in the area were renting for about $800 per month, so the numbers seemed legitimate. I projected expenses at 40% of gross rent and calculated a healthy cash flow.</p>
                <p>What I didn't account for: the seller had deferred maintenance for years. Within six months, I replaced the water heater ($1,200), repaired a roof leak ($3,500), and dealt with a sewage backup that required excavation ($4,800). One tenant moved out and it took two months to re-rent the unit. Suddenly my "cash flowing" property was negative for the year.</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500"><strong class="text-white">The lesson:</strong> Whatever your expense projection is, increase it by 25%. Then increase your vacancy assumption by 25%. If the deal still works, proceed. If not, you're gambling on everything going perfectly. It won't.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Lesson 2: Renovations Always Cost More Than You Think</h2>
                <p>In 2012, I bought a property that needed cosmetic updates. I got three contractor bids averaging $18,000. I budgeted $22,000 to be safe—20% over the estimates. I felt responsible and conservative.</p>
                <p>The actual cost was $31,000. Why? The contractor found structural issues during demolition that weren't visible during inspection. Material costs increased mid-project. The timeline stretched from six weeks to fourteen weeks, extending my holding costs.</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500"><strong class="text-white">The lesson:</strong> For renovation budgets, add 50% to contractor estimates for properties you haven't fully gutted. For properties where you can't see behind walls, add 75%. Have a contingency line item in your budget that's at least 20% of the total renovation estimate. You will use it.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Lesson 3: Good Neighborhoods Matter More Than Good Deals</h2>
                <p>I once bought a property in a declining neighborhood because the numbers were outstanding. The purchase price was 60% of what comparable properties were selling for just two miles away. The cash flow was strong. I congratulated myself on finding a deal everyone else had missed.</p>
                <p>They hadn't missed it. They'd avoided it for good reason. The neighborhood continued declining. Tenant quality deteriorated. Police calls became common. When I tried to refinance three years later, the property had lost 15% of its value despite improvements in surrounding areas.</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500"><strong class="text-white">The lesson:</strong> Location isn't just a real estate cliche—it's the fundamental truth of the business. A mediocre property in a strong neighborhood will outperform a strong property in a mediocre neighborhood almost every time.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Lesson 4: Screening Tenants Is Worth Whatever It Costs</h2>
                <p>Early in my investing career, I had a vacancy I needed to fill. A couple applied with decent credit scores and stable employment. Their income was three times the rent. I called their previous landlord, who gave a positive reference. I approved them.</p>
                <p>Four months later, they stopped paying rent. The eviction took three months and cost $4,500 in legal fees and lost rent. When they finally left, they'd caused $8,000 in damage beyond the security deposit. Total cost: $12,500.</p>
                <p>What I later learned: the previous landlord gave a good reference because he was relieved to be rid of them and didn't want to jeopardize their ability to move out.</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500"><strong class="text-white">The lesson:</strong> Tenant screening is not a cost center—it's loss prevention. Pay for professional background checks. Call every previous landlord going back at least three years, not just the most recent one. A bad tenant will cost you more than a month of vacancy ever will.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Lesson 5: Your Time Has Value</h2>
                <p>I spent two years managing my own properties to "save money" on property management fees. I calculated that property management would cost me about $2,400 per year across my portfolio. I was proud of saving that money.</p>
                <p>What I didn't calculate: the time I spent showing units, coordinating repairs, dealing with tenant calls, and handling maintenance issues. At a conservative estimate, I was spending six hours per week on property management. That's over 300 hours per year—which means I was paying myself less than $8 per hour for work I didn't enjoy.</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500"><strong class="text-white">The lesson:</strong> Your time has an opportunity cost. If property management takes you away from higher-value activities—whether that's finding better deals, growing your business, or having a life—it's not saving you money. It's costing you money.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Real Lesson</h2>
                <p>Every mistake here came from the same source: optimism. I wanted deals to work, so I convinced myself they would. I underestimated costs, overestimated income, and assumed I could manage risks that turned out to be larger than expected.</p>
                <p class="font-semibold text-white">Conservative investing isn't about being pessimistic. It's about being realistic, building in margins of safety, and accepting that things will go wrong. Plan for it.</p>
