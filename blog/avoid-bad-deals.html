                    Most people don't lose money in real estate because they're reckless. They lose money because they accept assumptions without making them earn their place.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    A deal that <em>almost</em> works feels convincing. The spreadsheet is close. The broker sounds confident. The upside feels reasonable.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    But "almost" is where most financial damage lives.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-gray-800 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 my-8">
                    <p class="text-white font-medium">If a deal needs rent growth, appreciation, or refinancing just to survive, it isn't strong. It's fragile.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Reality vs. Hope</h2>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong class="text-white">A good real estate deal survives reality as it exists today.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    A bad deal needs the future to cooperate.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This distinction matters more than market cycles, interest rates, or timing. Strong deals tolerate vacancies, repairs, rate changes, and slow growth. Weak deals collapse when a single assumption fails.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    This is why experienced investors say no far more often than yes.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Reality Check</h2>

                        <span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">&#10003;</span>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Cash Flow vs. Appreciation</h2>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Many investors confuse cash flow and appreciation, treating them as equal contributors to success.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    They aren't.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-gray-800 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><strong>Cash flow is control.</strong> It pays the mortgage, absorbs mistakes, and buys time.</p>
                    <p class="text-white"><strong>Appreciation is permission.</strong> It rewards investors who already survived long enough to benefit from it.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    When appreciation becomes the reason a deal works, risk is being ignored. When cash flow is thin, leverage does dangerous work in silence.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Hard Questions</h2>

                <ul class="space-y-4 mb-8">
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-yellow-400 mt-1">?</span>
                        <span class="text-gray-300">If appreciation disappeared, would the deal still function?</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-yellow-400 mt-1">?</span>
                        <span class="text-gray-300">If rents stayed flat for three years, could you hold?</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-yellow-400 mt-1">?</span>
                        <span class="text-gray-300">If interest rates rose, would leverage magnify pain?</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
                        <span class="text-yellow-400 mt-1">?</span>
                        <span class="text-gray-300">If refinancing were delayed, would the deal survive?</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The goal in real estate is not to move fast.

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The goal is to stay solvent long enough to get better.
